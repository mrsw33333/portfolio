<h1>Survival</h1>
				<p>Consider your purchase behavior. Do you make unwise purchases? Can you live without some of the items you frequently purchase? Are you practicing good consumer behavior? Simply increasing our consumption as a result of alluring discounts or offers would harm both the environment and us. By simply buying what you need, whether it be for food, clothing, accessories, or household items, you cut down on waste production and pollution. Due to the scarcity of natural resources, overconsumption can be detrimental to the biodiversity of our world.</p>
